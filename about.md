Hi, my name is Winnie. Welcome to my online portfolio  page. This is where I showcase my portfolio and projects related to AI, machine learning and NLP.
I have an MD degree and a Masters of Public Health in Biostatistics and epidemiology at the University of Illinois in Chicago.


Data Science is intriguing to me because I have always had the passion of solving puzzles and looking for relevant information and patterns to help the lives of people especially in the health care field.


I have over two years of experience as a data scientist with specialization in data wrangling, data processing, visualization, machine learning algorithms and results communication.


You can also connect with me on LinkedIn and visit my GitHub.
